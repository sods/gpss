<p>It's best if you get the ipython notebook working locally on your own computer. If you can't get it working, you can try using the remote server.

<h3>Step 1: Make yourself your own space</h3>

You need to invent a unique id that is just made of letters (for example 'michael' or 'neil').

Enter it here:

<form action="http://10.10.13.23:5000/generate" method="get">
 <p>Your id: <input type="text" name="user" /></p>
 <p><input type="submit" /></p>
</form>

<h3>Step 2: Connect to ipython and find your folder</h3>

<p>You can connect to ipython by clicking on the link below. You should be able to see your id as one of the folders. Click on it to get started. <a href="http://10.10.13.23:8888">Go to ipython notebooks</a>.</p>
