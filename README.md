Gaussian process material for summer school teaching.

## Software and infrastructure (for Data Science Africa)
Below are instructions and advice for deploying the DSA summer school.

### Infrastructure
In previous years we've had some trouble with the bandwidth available both to the Internet and *locally* between computers. It is maybe best to develop the summer school under the assumption that there is no network, and any that exists we need to utilise when possible.

Hardware to take:
 - memory sticks for sneakernet to distribute everything. In particular anaconda is 474Mb (need a copy for windows and linux)
 - wifi access point
 - laptops (to run servers on)
 - cables (ethernet, etc)
 - video recording equipment

### Server Software
I ran an apache server on my laptop, and created a small webpage from which people can
 - download anaconda
 - download the jupyter notebooks and associated datafiles
 - download the lecture slides
 - create a new folder for the jupyter notebook (a small flask python script did this)
 - 

### Information

### Questions

- Which version of python are we using?
- How do we distribute modules (i.e. sods, GPy) people might need.
- We're assuming most computers are going to be laptops (and thus connect via wifi)
